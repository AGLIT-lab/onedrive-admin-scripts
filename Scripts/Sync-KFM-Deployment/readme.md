# Windows Known Folder Move (KFM) deployment #

## Summary ##

The script will create a txt file that shows 4 things:

- Know Folder Move (KFM) eligibility (for whatever device it was run on)
- Payload details (number of items and size of content within known folders) 
- KFM status (have the known folders been moved to OneDrive)
- KFM GPO state (what GPOs have been set)

The execution of the script can be done via Intune or other management tools that can execute a PowerShell script across Windows 10 devices.  A TenantID as well as an output path is required.  This level of detail will provide a better deployment of KFM.

> More details around the Known Folder Move capability is available from the [official OneDrive documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/redirect-known-folders).
